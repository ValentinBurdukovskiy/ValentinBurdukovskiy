## About me

Hi! I've been interested in programming since I was 11 years old, at 13 I started learning my first language – PHP, and at the moment I've been doing web development for about three years.

For me, programming is not just another hobby, like website design or writing, but one of my favorite activities, more precisely web development, with which I would like to connect my future life.
